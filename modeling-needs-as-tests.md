# Needs as Tests

## Simplification by Automation

There are many flavors of Automation:

- Automate the performance of the test (check remains manual)
- Automate the check (performance remains manual)
- Automate both performance and check
- Automate the production process

`Exercise: When is Software update flow successful?
What part of it can we automate?`

## Impact Analysis

- With automation: Ideally, just run it
- Without automation: Change-Control-Board = don't try it yourself!
