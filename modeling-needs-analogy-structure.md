## Modeling to Understand

### Use-case: Power auction

![powergrid](images/power-grid.jpg "power grid")

Terms: Power, Transmission-loss, Renewable, Capacity, Demand, Auction

Analogy = e-bay

### Smaller analogies

- Register for conference & pay = shopping cart
- MQTT 'at least once' delivery = movie streaming
- MQTT 'fire and forget' = live telecast
- SQL = rows+columns
- MongoDB = documents
- JSON = hierarchical

## Modeling for Commitment

Examples:

- Requirement for a safety component in aeronautics = redundancy + fault-recovery
- Intended use of clinical equipment
- Regulatory claims and ratings

Hardware example: IPX rating
