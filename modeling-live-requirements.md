# Product Quality is Alive

## Product Quality

...is the experience given to users, without which they stop using the product.

[ISO/IEC 25010](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57a5/b99eceff9da205e244337c9f4678b5b23d25.pdf)
lists product quality attributes.

- Quality in use: Relates to the outcomes of interaction with a system
- Product Quality:  The experience given by the product

`Exercise: Identify a product with great quality but not much use`
