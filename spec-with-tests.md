# Specify with Tests

By Specifying before Implementation,
we ensure that the team knows 'when it's done'.
Without a specification, we don't know when we are done
and we have no business producing it either!

Let's take an example.

Requirement: Simulate a throw of dice

Specification 'somewhat': Show a number between 1 and 6

Specified as a test: Show a number between 1 and 6,
ensuring that four consecutive throws don't show the same number
and the sequence is different every time we start the game.

As you can see in the example,
wording the requirement as a specification/test
yields direction to the selection of a random-number-generator.
