## Pitfalls in Tracking and Tracing

### Requirements can be in multiple states

- Approved in one country, not (yet) in another
- Vital for one customer, undesirable for another
- Illegal in one region, profitable in another

### Implementation overtakes requirements

- Because requirements are hard to change
- Cross-system changes are hard to capture
- Change in 3rd party dependency gives different behavior

### Legacy shackles are unknown

- Product with large installed base; unclear what users like
- Profits feed Organization-complexity and fear of change
